EnderBow
========

Have you ever wanted to teleport around you world quickly, without losing all of your ender pearls?
If you've ever wanted any of those, you have come to the right place!

## So what does it do?

With EnderBow, you can craft an Ender Bow, of which you can shoot normal arrows and teleport to their landing spot,
similar to throwing an ender pearl. Currently EnderBow uses up arrows in your inventory, and shoots ender pearls.
